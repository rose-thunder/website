        It has been awhile since I have updated this website. I have been
        super busy with school so that has taken up a bunch of my time. As
        classes are wrapping up for this semester I have a little bit of a
        break now and then so I'll be updated this website every now and then.
        I hope to update this site on a somewhat regular basis but who knows.
        <br />
        I have also decided to change what pronouns I go by. I used to use
        she/they/he, I now use she/it/they :)

      <p>
        At the end of last blog post I mentioned my ex. My friends have been
        supporting me while navigating my PTSD and emotions regarding my ex.
        My support network is the best. It is my first time ever really having
        real friends which is nice. I love my friends (platonically)

      <h1>A New Beginning!</h1>

        This website is not my first, but my second. I wanted to restart my
        website as I didn't like how things looked and felt limited by the
        free plan of neocities. Also, the neocities CLI was very cumbersome.
        That is why I switched over to github pages as there are a lot less
        restrictions than on neocities. I also find the workflow much easier
        on github than on neocities.

        Other than that I have just started my sophmore year of college and I
        am so excited for what the future holds. Unlike freshman year I have
        been able to make a lot of friends. I've also been making a lot of
        discoveries about myself. For example, I somewhat recently came out as
        Genderfluid. But at the same time my PTSD has resurfaced which sucks.
        On my previous site I talked about my boyfriend. Let's just say that
        we're exes now and I'm now having flashbacks again.

        On a much lighter note, I have been loving my sophmore year of
        college. I have been living in the LGBTQ+ wing of my dorm which is so
        awsome and affirming. Living with queer people as a queer is amazing
        10/10 would recommend. My dormmates are so amazing and so nice. It is
        such a nice community. :)
