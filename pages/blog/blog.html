      <p>
        My birtday is tommorrow and I couldn't be more excited tbh. I'm
        turning 20 which feels so unreal to say. I can't beileve that I'm
        gonna be 20. I think the realization just hit me while writing this
        damn...

      <h1>Why I'm Looking Foward to the Future in these Uncertain Times</h1>
      <span class="date">5/2/25</span>
      <br />
      <p>
        This year hasn't been the best for anyone, espically if you live in
        America like myself. 2025 has been really bad for me because of my
        personal life in addition to the horridness of America. But that's not
        what I want to focus on today, I want to focus on why I'm looking
        foward to the future. Hopefully, this blog post will make you more
        optimistic for the future like me.

      <h2>Being Queer</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Now this might seem counterintuitive given the current political
        climate. However, I believe many people forget that queer people have
        been around and survived so much throughout history. We as queer
        people will survive this era no matter how bad it gets. No matter how
        hard it may get we will persevere, it is what we're good at.
      </p>

      <h2>The Inevitable Fall of AI</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        It seems like today that AI is inescapable, but I firmly believe that
        in 5 years the presence of AI will be greatly reduced. The reason I
        believe this is due the similarities between the rise of AI and the
        Dot-Com bubble.
        <a href="https://youtu.be/gMmY2fjFOzE?si=brsOHVlfUxIQNEDj">This video</a>
        explains the similarities elegantly. The main difference between the
        Dot-Com bubble and the AI bubble is, during the Dot-Com bubble the
        companies were publically traded while the AI bubble is funded by
        venture capitalists. Just like the Dot-Com bubble AI is being
        plastered into anything and everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now what will happen when this AI bubble bursts? Microsoft at the time
        of writing this, owns 49% of OpenAI, the creators of ChatGPT. Looking
        at history when Time Warner and AOL merged it was a disater and AOL is
        a relic of the past only remembered by nostaligic internet users like
        myself. Therefore, OpenAI and AI in general may be forgotten in a few
        years. Microsoft can exsit without AI, however there is no OpenAI
        without AI.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I haven't made it clear, I'm not the biggest fan of AI. AI steals
        from the internet and gives inaccurate information on most topics
        anyway. If you use AI in your workflow or to learn something you tend
        to rely on it heavily. For example, there is a phenomonon in coding
        called the "Copilot Pause". Github Copilot is an AI powered
        programming tool that autocompletes your code and makes you code
        "faster". However if someone has been using Copilot for awhile and
        turn it off, their brain is trained to wait for Copliot to
        autocomplete for you, and thus the pause.
      </p>

      <h2>Creative Hobbies</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        I believe everyone needs a creative hobby or multiple. I have been
        really enjoying writing, drawing, and learning how to make music. I
        recommend picking up a creative hobby because it allows you to express
        yourself in new and fun ways. It also is a way to resist as you can
        use your art as a way to protest. I can't wait to go back after
        writing this to make something with my creative juices. My hobbies
        allow me to look at the future and get inspired!
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        All in all, I think there are many things to look forward to in the
        future and hopefully this blog post made it so that your future is
        more optimistic.

      <h1>Deeply Stressed</h1>
      <span class="date">4/12/25</span>
      <br />
      <p>
        I haven't been updated this website in a long time due to my personal
        life. I've honestly been a really stressed mess. I've been dealing
        with a lot stuff I'm not ready to get into on here. It's been a deeply
        stressful time these past few months. However, I'm comitted to
        updating my website more often!

      <h1>Update from Me!</h1>
      <span class="date">11/22/24</span>
      <br />
      <p>
        It has been awhile since I have updated this website. I have been
        super busy with school so that has taken up a bunch of my time. As
        classes are wrapping up for this semester I have a little bit of a
        break now and then so I'll be updated this website every now and then.
        I hope to update this site on a somewhat regular basis but who knows.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have also decided to change what pronouns I go by. I used to use
        she/they/he, I now use she/it/they :)

      <h1>Support from Friends</h1>
      <span class="date">10/2/24</span>
      <br />
      <p>
        At the end of last blog post I mentioned my ex. My friends have been
        supporting me while navigating my mental health and emotions regarding
        my ex. My support network is the best. It is my first time ever really
        having real friends which is nice. I love my friends (platonically)

      <h1>A New Beginning!</h1>
      <span class="date">9/15/24</span>
      <br />
      <p>
        This website is not my first, but my second. I wanted to restart my
        website as I didn't like how things looked and felt limited by the
        free plan of neocities. Also, the neocities CLI was very cumbersome.
        That is why I switched over to github pages as there are a lot less
        restrictions than on neocities. I also find the workflow much easier
        on github than on neocities.
      </p>

        Other than that I have just started my sophmore year of college and I
        am so excited for what the future holds. Unlike freshman year I have
        been able to make a lot of friends. I've also been making a lot of
        discoveries about myself. For example, I somewhat recently came out as
        Genderfluid. But at the same time my PTSD has resurfaced which sucks.
        On my previous site I talked about my boyfriend. Let's just say that
        we're exes now and I'm now having flashbacks again.
      </p>

        On a much lighter note, I have been loving my sophmore year of
        college. I have been living in the LGBTQ+ wing of my dorm which is so
        awsome and affirming. Living with queer people as a queer is amazing
        10/10 would recommend. My dormmates are so amazing and so nice. It is
        such a nice community. :)
