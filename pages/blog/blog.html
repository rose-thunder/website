        <h1>Deeply Stressed</h1>
        <br />

        <p>
          I haven't been updated this website in a long time due to my personal
          life. I've honestly been a really stressed mess. I've been dealing
          with a lot stuff I'm not ready to get into on here. It's been a deeply
          stressful time these past few months. However, I'm comitted to
          updating my website more often!

        <h1>Update from Me!</h1>

        <span class="date">11/22/24</span>
        <br />
        <p>
          It has been awhile since I have updated this website. I have been
          super busy with school so that has taken up a bunch of my time. As
          classes are wrapping up for this semester I have a little bit of a
          break now and then so I'll be updated this website every now and then.
          I hope to update this site on a somewhat regular basis but who knows.
          <br />
          I have also decided to change what pronouns I go by. I used to use
          she/they/he, I now use she/it/they :)

        <h1>Support from Friends</h1>

        <span class="date">10/2/24</span>
        <br />
        <p>
          At the end of last blog post I mentioned my ex. My friends have been
          supporting me while navigating my mental health and emotions regarding
          my ex. My support network is the best. It is my first time ever really
          having real friends which is nice. I love my friends (platonically)

        <h1>A New Beginning!</h1>

          This website is not my first, but my second. I wanted to restart my
          website as I didn't like how things looked and felt limited by the
          free plan of neocities. Also, the neocities CLI was very cumbersome.
          That is why I switched over to github pages as there are a lot less
          restrictions than on neocities. I also find the workflow much easier
          on github than on neocities.

          Other than that I have just started my sophmore year of college and I
          am so excited for what the future holds. Unlike freshman year I have
          been able to make a lot of friends. I've also been making a lot of
          discoveries about myself. For example, I somewhat recently came out as
          Genderfluid. But at the same time my PTSD has resurfaced which sucks.
          On my previous site I talked about my boyfriend. Let's just say that
          we're exes now and I'm now having flashbacks again.

          On a much lighter note, I have been loving my sophmore year of
          college. I have been living in the LGBTQ+ wing of my dorm which is so
          awsome and affirming. Living with queer people as a queer is amazing
          10/10 would recommend. My dormmates are so amazing and so nice. It is
          such a nice community. :)
