        <h1>My Minecraft Story</h1>
        <p>
          Everyone has at least some experience with minecraft and this is my
          story with the game.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>The Start!!!</h2>
        <p>
          I started playing minecraft when Xbox 360 for Christmas one year. I
          have so many memories of playing on the 360 version with my brother.
          We would usually play on a creative superflat world. My brother would
          usually work on a theme park, while I would make whatever I wanted. We
          might've had to split the world in halves because of the world size
          limit on Legacy Console Version. We created so much on that world I'm
          so happy that the same Xbox is safe and sound in storage.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>The Dark Age...</h2>
        <p>
          Eventually, Legacy Console updates came out much slower and slower and
          eventually stopped. The last update for Xbox 360 was Update Aquatic.
          With the lack of updates we both stopped playing the game. But I
          eventually get back into minecraft through YouTube and nostalgia, and
          bought Minecraft Java Edition.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>The Renaissance!!!</h2>
        <p>
          Once I bought Java Edition, it was the same magic all those years ago.
          I had never played survival mode (shocking I know) so this was my
          first time and I think it's a good compliment to creative mode.
          However I never really stuck with a world which I think is a problem
          with survival mode. With every new update you're rewareded for
          resetting your world.
