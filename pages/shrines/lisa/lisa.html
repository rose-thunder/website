        <h1>What is LISA?</h1>
        <p>
          LISA is a trilogy of RPG Maker games made by Austin Jorgensen. The
          trilogy follows and explores the Armstrong family and their many many
          flaws.
          <br />
          The first game in the series, LISA: The First, follows Lisa Armstrong
          in a trippy nightmarish world. By the end of the game it becomes clear
          that Lisa was raped by her abusive father, Marty Armstrong. The first
          game is probably the least significant in the overall plot and it was
          the last game I played in the series.
          <br />
          The second and most popular game in the series, LISA: The Painful
          follows Lisa's brother Brad Armstrong.
