        <h2>What is Khonjin House?</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Khonjin House is a web series created by Khonjin. Khonjin House
          started in 2015 and ended in 2016, ended again in 2019, and finally
          ended in 2021 The series consists of short comedy videos that are
          seemingly unrelated. The Khonjin House universe is absolute nonsense
          and <i>anything</i> can happen.

        <h2>My Experience</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          I think i discovered the series in 2016. The original Khonjin House
          movie was in my YouTube recommended and I decieded to watch it because
          of the thumbnail. Little did I know, I stumbled upon my favorite web
          series ever.
